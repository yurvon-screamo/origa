# Anki Alternative for Japanese: When to Switch (and When to Stick With Anki)

Anki is the default answer to "how do I memorize Japanese vocabulary." It earned that reputation. It's also a tool that asks a lot of you: build the deck, design the card template, find audio, configure the scheduler, sync across devices. Some learners love that freedom. Others spend more time managing Anki than studying Japanese.

This is a field guide, not a hit piece. It covers where Anki genuinely wins for Japanese, where it gets in the way, what "an alternative" should actually offer, and how a few of the current options compare — including Origa, the app I work on.

## Where Anki wins

If any of these describe you, Anki is probably the right tool, and you should stop reading listicles and go review your cards.

- **You want a scheduler you fully control.** Anki added FSRS support in 2023 and enables it by default for new collections. It's the same spaced-repetition algorithm the research community converged on. You can tune retention targets, custom steps, and review limits to the day.
- **You study more than Japanese.** Anki is domain-agnostic. Medicine, law, music theory, a third language — one app, one review queue.
- **You build your own card types.** Anki's templating (HTML/CSS with fields) is unmatched. If you enjoy engineering your cards as much as studying them, nothing else comes close.
- **You want it free and self-hosted.** Anki desktop is free and open source. AnkiDroid is free. AnkiWeb sync is free. The only paid piece is AnkiMobile on iOS, which funds development of the rest.

That last point matters. "Free and open" isn't a marketing line for Anki — it's the structural reason the ecosystem has thousands of shared decks and a decade of community maintenance.

## Where Anki gets in the way for Japanese specifically

Anki is a generic engine. Japanese isn't generic. The friction shows up at exactly the places where Japanese differs from a Spanish vocab deck.

**Card creation is manual by default.** To add a word, you typically open a dictionary, copy the word, paste it, copy the reading, paste it, copy the translation, paste it, find audio somewhere, attach it. Do this for a hundred words and you've lost an evening.

**Kanji and vocabulary live as separate concerns.** Anki doesn't know that 食べる and 食事 share a kanji, or that you "know" a kanji once you've seen it in five different words. You build that linkage yourself, or you don't get it.

**Furigana is something you add, not something you have.** Hiding furigana on kanji you've learned — so you're forced to recall the reading — requires a custom setup. Out of the box, furigana is either always on or always off.

**Grammar is a separate app.** Most learners pair Anki with a grammar SRS (Bunpro) or a textbook. Anki has no concept of "explain this grammar point using words I already know," because it has no concept of which words you know.

**The interface assumes English.** Anki's UI is English-first. There are community translations and Russian community decks, but the app was not designed for someone learning Japanese *through* Russian, Vietnamese, or Korean.

None of this is a flaw in Anki. Anki does exactly what it set out to do. It's a sign that Anki is a general tool and Japanese is a specific problem.

## What a good alternative should offer

If you're shopping for "an Anki alternative for Japanese," the question isn't "is there something easier." Lots of things are easier and worse. The useful question is: **does it remove a specific piece of friction without giving up the parts of Anki that matter?**

A checklist that's actually useful:

- **Same scheduler quality.** If the alternative uses naive Leitner boxes or a fixed interval, you're trading real retention for convenience. Look for FSRS or a documented SRS algorithm.
- **Built-in Japanese dictionaries in your language.** If adding a card still requires an external dictionary lookup, you've moved the friction, not removed it.
- **Automatic furigana with smart hiding.** Furigana should appear on kanji you haven't learned and disappear on kanji you have — without a custom template.
- **Kanji and vocabulary that know about each other.** The tool should treat 食べる and 食事 as related, not as unrelated cards.
- **OCR or text extraction.** Being able to add words from a photo of a manga page or a textbook screenshot is the difference between studying your content and studying someone else's word list.
- **A grammar path that uses your vocabulary.** Otherwise grammar is a second app again.

If an "alternative" fails the first item (scheduler quality), it's not an alternative — it's a downgrade wearing a friendlier interface.

## How Origa handles this

Origa is the app I work on, so I'll be specific and you can check the claims. It exists because the "five apps for one language" problem described above is exactly what its author ran into.

A few concrete differences from Anki, with the honest caveat that **both use FSRS** — Origa didn't invent the algorithm, and Anki didn't fall behind on it. The scheduling quality is comparable. Where they differ is everything around the scheduler.

| Concern | Anki | Origa |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scheduler | FSRS (added 2023, default for new collections) | FSRS, configured per-deck |
| Adding a word | Manual dictionary lookup + paste | Type a word; built-in bilingual dictionary fills reading, translation, audio |
| Furigana | Add manually or via template | Generated automatically; hides on learned kanji |
| Kanji ↔ vocabulary linkage | You build it | Built-in; kanji tracked across the words you've seen |
| Grammar | Separate app | Structured grammar reference, examples use words you've learned |
| OCR card creation | Not built-in | Scan a photo; words extracted into cards |
| Interface languages | English (community translations exist) | English, Russian, Vietnamese, Korean |
| Import from Anki | — | Imports `.anki2` / `.anki21` decks |

That last row matters if you're considering a switch: you don't have to throw away years of Anki progress. Origa imports existing Anki decks, so the migration cost is low.

### Known limitations (the honest part)

- **Origa is not as customizable as Anki.** If you live in custom HTML/CSS card templates, Origa won't replace that. It optimizes for low-friction defaults over maximal control.
- **It's newer.** Anki has a decade-plus of edge-case hardening and a huge deck ecosystem. Origa's library of pre-built content is growing but smaller.
- **AnkiMobile on iOS has no Origa equivalent yet.** Origa runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and the web; iOS is on the roadmap but not shipping today. If your entire study flow is on an iPhone, that's a real blocker.
- **The desktop/mobile feature parity is good but not absolute.** Check the current build for your platform before committing.

If any of those break your workflow, that's a legitimate reason to stay on Anki or run both.

## Other alternatives, briefly

Origa isn't the only option, and depending on your bottleneck it may not be the best one for you.

- **For kanji specifically — WaniKani.** Radical-based, structured order, English interface. Best if you're starting kanji from zero and want a fixed path. It's paid, and its order is its own — you learn what it teaches, not what you encountered today.
- **For grammar specifically — Bunpro.** Grammar-focused SRS, web-based, English interface. Best if your bottleneck is grammar drilling and you're happy to keep vocabulary in Anki.
- **For absolute beginners — Duolingo.** Gamified, gentle, shallow. Not a replacement for Anki's retention; a starting point that you outgrow.
- **For JLPT test simulation — Migii.** Timed test practice. Pairs with a retention tool rather than replacing one.

The pattern: most "alternatives" specialize in one slice (kanji, grammar, beginners, tests). The reason people end up on five apps is that no single specialized tool covers the whole. Origa's pitch is that it's the one tool trying to cover the whole — but read the limitations above before assuming that fits you.

## How to decide

Use Anki if you value control, study multiple subjects, or have already invested in a deck system that works. You lose nothing by staying.

Consider Origa if your friction is specifically Japanese card creation, you want furigana and kanji linkage handled for you, you study through a language other than English, or you're tired of stitching grammar onto a vocabulary tool. Import your Anki deck first — if the workflow clicks, keep it; if not, you're back where you started.

The honest version of "best Anki alternative" is "the one that removes *your* friction." Figure out which step of your current routine eats the most time, and pick the tool that removes that step without dropping the scheduler quality.

## FAQ

**Is Origa's spaced repetition the same as Anki's?**
Both use FSRS. Origa didn't invent it and doesn't claim to. The difference is what surrounds the scheduler — card creation, furigana, kanji tracking, grammar — not the algorithm itself.

**Can I keep my Anki decks?**
Yes. Origa imports `.anki2`, `.anki21`, and `.anki21b` formats, so existing decks and review history transfer over.

**Is Origa free?**
Yes, it's currently free to use across all platforms.

**Does Origa work offline?**
Yes. The OCR and speech-to-text models run locally, so card creation and review work without an internet connection.

**What if I only study on iPhone?**
Not yet. Origa runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and web. iOS is planned but not available today — if iPhone is your only device, wait for the iOS release or stay on Anki.
