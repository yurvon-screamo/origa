# Japanese AI Tutors: What They're Good At (and What They're Not)

"Japanese AI tutor" is one of the fastest-growing search categories in language learning. ChatGPT made it possible to have an endlessly patient conversation partner that explains grammar on demand, corrects your writing, and never gets tired of your questions. A wave of apps has built products on top of that.

This article is not a ranking. It's a breakdown of what AI tutors are actually good at, where they fall short, and where they fit in a serious Japanese-learning workflow. The honest version is that AI tutors are excellent at one half of the job and absent from the other half. Conflating the two is how learners end up paying for a chatbot subscription and forgetting everything they "learned" by next month.

Includes Origa, the app I work on, positioned honestly — Origa uses AI, but it is not an AI tutor in the conversational sense most people mean.

## What AI tutors are genuinely good at

When the underlying model is competent (and current models are, for Japanese up to intermediate level), AI tutors handle four things better than any textbook:

**On-demand grammar explanation.** You saw ばかり in a manga and the textbook explanation doesn't fit. Paste the sentence into a chatbot, ask "why is ばかり used here?", and you get a contextual answer in seconds. Textbooks can't do this because they're written in advance.

**Sentence correction with reasoning.** Write a sentence, ask "is this natural?", and a good AI tutor will mark what's off and explain why. A human tutor does this better, but Japanese specialists typically run tens of US dollars per hour and often much more — the AI does it for a flat subscription.

**Conversation practice without shame.** Most learners won't speak out loud because they're embarrassed. An AI doesn't judge. Two minutes of "let's talk about my day" with an AI builds confidence in a way that textbooks can't.

**Reading support.** Paste a paragraph you can't parse, ask for a translation and a breakdown. Faster than flipping between three reference sites.

These are real, valuable capabilities. If you've ever been stuck on a single sentence for 20 minutes because no dictionary explained the grammar, you know how much an AI tutor can save you.

## What AI tutors are not good at

The hard part is the next sentence, which most app marketing skips: **none of those capabilities help you remember anything.**

- **AI tutors don't schedule your reviews.** The forgetting curve doesn't care that you understood ばかり on Tuesday. By Friday, it's gone. Without spaced repetition, AI-tutor "learning" evaporates within a week.
- **AI tutors don't build a vocabulary pipeline.** You can ask about a word, get a great explanation, and have no way to capture that word for later review. Most AI tutor apps have a "save" feature; almost nobody reviews what they save.
- **AI tutors don't give you a curriculum.** They respond to what you ask. If you don't know what to ask, you wander. Beginners need structure; AI gives you whatever you bring.
- **AI tutors don't replace listening or reading.** Conversation practice with a bot is a specific skill, not a substitute for 30 minutes of immersion in real Japanese.
- **AI tutors plateau.** For intermediate and above, the corrections get subtly wrong in ways a learner can't catch. The model confidently endorses a sentence that a native would find odd. You learn mistakes.

The pattern across most "AI tutor" apps is the same: they ship the conversation/correction capability, leave the retention to the user, and bill it as a complete solution. It isn't.

## The three categories of "AI tutor" app

### General-purpose LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)

**Strength:** the best models in the world, for roughly $200/year (or free with limits). You can have a Japanese conversation in one tab and ask for grammar help in another.

**Weakness:** the burden is entirely on you to design the session. You have to know what to ask, when to switch from conversation to explanation, when to write vs. read. There's no SRS, no curriculum, no vocabulary capture beyond copy-paste into a separate app.

**Best for:** intermediate-and-up learners who already have a structured workflow and want an infinitely patient helper on the side.

### Dedicated AI language apps (Speak, Talkpal, Praktika, etc.)

**Strength:** the AI is wrapped in a learning-shaped UI — scenario cards, progress badges, lesson flows. The conversation is guided, so you don't have to invent the topic.

**Weakness:** the SRS layer is usually thin or absent. Lessons are pre-built; vocabulary capture is weak; long-term retention is on you. Subscription pricing compounds — Speak Premium Plus is ~$30/month, Talkpal Premium ~$20/month, Praktika ~$100/year (prices fluctuate by region and platform). For Japanese specifically, the depth is often shallower than for English or Spanish — the market is smaller, and the AI training data for Japanese learning scenarios is thinner.

**Best for:** learners who want guided conversation practice and don't mind paying for the structure.

### Learning-integrated AI (where Origa sits, partially)

Origa uses AI — local OCR (NDLOCR-Lite), local speech-to-text (Whisper), furigana generation, automated vocabulary extraction — but it is **not an AI tutor in the conversational sense**. It does not have a chatbot. It does not explain grammar on demand.

What Origa does is use AI as the entry point to a retention pipeline. You scan a page, the AI reads the words; you record audio, the AI transcribes it; you paste text, the AI extracts vocabulary. Each captured item becomes a flashcard scheduled by FSRS. The AI is the input layer, not the teaching layer.

The framing: an AI tutor and Origa are not substitutes. An AI tutor explains a grammar point; Origa makes sure you remember the words in the example sentence. Most serious learners end up using both — a chatbot for one-off questions, an SRS for the things that matter.

## What to look for in an AI tutor

A checklist that actually separates value from hype:

- **Is the AI connected to a retention mechanism?** If "save this word" doesn't feed an SRS, the AI is entertainment.
- **Is the AI correction reliable at your level?** Test with sentences you already know the answer to. If the AI is wrong on those, it'll be worse on what you don't know.
- **Is the AI guidance optional or required?** Beginners benefit from structure (guided flows). Intermediate learners benefit from free-form. Pick the right shape for your level.
- **Where does the AI run?** Cloud-based AI is smarter but logs every interaction. On-device AI is private but less capable. Neither is universally better.
- **What's the subscription math?** As of mid-2026: ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro and Gemini Advanced are each ~$200/year (~$17/month); dedicated AI language apps run higher — Speak ~$30/month, Talkpal ~$20/month, Praktika ~$100/year. Stack one of those with a paid SRS or kanji app and you're comfortably at $30–50/month recurring, $360–600/year, indefinitely. Check whether a one-time-purchase or source-available alternative closes most of the gap.

## How Origa uses AI

Concretely, where Origa's AI sits:

- **Local OCR (NDLOCR-Lite).** On-device. Scans photos and screenshots to extract Japanese words.
- **Local STT (Whisper).** On-device. Transcribes audio you record for vocabulary mining.
- **Local furigana generation.** On-device. Adds readings to kanji automatically.
- **Vocabulary extraction.** Paste a sentence; the system identifies and parses individual words.
- **No conversational AI.** Origa does not chat with you. If you want grammar explanations on demand, pair it with ChatGPT or Claude.

The design choice is explicit: use AI where it removes friction from the capture pipeline, and leave the conversation/explanation layer to general-purpose LLMs that do it better.

## Known limitations (the honest part)

- **Origa does not replace an AI tutor.** If your bottleneck is "I need someone to explain grammar to me," Origa doesn't help. Use a chatbot.
- **Local AI has limits.** On-device OCR and STT are good but not as accurate as the best cloud services on stylised or noisy input. Expect occasional manual correction.
- **No AI-driven curriculum yet.** Origa's structure comes from JLPT levels and textbook imports, not from AI generating a learning path. This is a deliberate choice; an AI curriculum would introduce the same plateau problem as AI tutors.

## How to decide

If your study time is 30 minutes a day and you have to choose between an AI tutor and an SRS, choose the SRS. Spaced repetition is the one component of language learning where the evidence is unambiguous. The AI tutor is the more glamorous purchase, but it's the SRS that delivers the year-over-year progress.

If you can run both — an SRS for retention, an AI tutor for on-demand explanation and conversation practice — that's the actual best-of-both-worlds setup most intermediate-and-up learners converge on. Origa covers the SRS half and uses AI for input, not for conversation. ChatGPT or Claude covers the conversation half. The combination is cheaper and more effective than a single AI-tutor subscription that promises everything and delivers conversation plus weak retention.

## FAQ

**Can I learn Japanese just with ChatGPT?**
You can practice conversation and get grammar explanations. You will not retain what you learn without a separate SRS. ChatGPT alone is a tutor without a curriculum or a memory — useful, incomplete.

**Are AI tutor apps better than ChatGPT?**
For guided scenarios and structured lessons, yes — they wrap the AI in a learning flow. For raw flexibility, no. The best choice depends on whether you want structure (use an AI tutor app) or flexibility (use ChatGPT directly).

**Does Origa have an AI chatbot?**
No. Origa uses AI for OCR, speech-to-text, and vocabulary extraction — the input side of learning. For conversational AI, pair Origa with ChatGPT, Claude, or a dedicated AI tutor app.

**Is local AI as good as cloud AI?**
For OCR and STT on typical Japanese input: close, sometimes equal. For conversational AI: no, cloud models are substantially better. The trade-off is privacy and offline use vs. raw capability.

**What's the cheapest setup that works?**
ChatGPT free tier for grammar questions + Anki (free desktop, free AnkiDroid) for SRS. That's $0/month and covers most of what paid AI tutor apps offer, if you're willing to configure Anki.
