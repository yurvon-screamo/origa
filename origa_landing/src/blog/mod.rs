//! parses every article's frontmatter and body once, stores them in a
//! `OnceLock<Vec<BlogPost>>` (chosen over `LazyLock` for MSRV 1.75 —
//! `LazyLock` requires 1.80+), and subsequent lookups are zero-cost. A draft
//! article (`status: draft` in frontmatter) is a programmer error and panics
//! on first access — drafts must not ship.
