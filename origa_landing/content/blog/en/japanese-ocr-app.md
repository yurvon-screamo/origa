# Japanese OCR Apps: What They're Good For (and Where They Fall Short)

Typing Japanese into a dictionary is painful. If you don't know the reading of a kanji, you have to look it up by radical, which means counting strokes, identifying the radical, navigating a grid — a 60-second operation to find one word. On a phone it's worse. This is the problem OCR solves: photograph the text, get the reading and the meaning in seconds.

But "Japanese OCR app" is a vague search, and most of the apps that come up under it solve only the first half of a longer problem. They give you a reading. They don't help you remember it. This is a guide to what the different types of OCR apps are actually good at, where each of them falls short, and what to look for if you're trying to learn Japanese — not just decode a single sign.

This includes Origa, the app I work on, with its limitations called out plainly.

## What OCR for Japanese actually solves

There are three real use cases, and they pull in different directions:

1. **Translation lookup.** You're at a restaurant, the menu is all kanji, you need to know what's in the dish. You want fast OCR + reliable translation. You don't care about learning.
2. **Reading support.** You're reading a manga, a textbook, or a news article. You want to OCR a sentence or a panel, get the readings of unknown words, and keep going. You're learning, but the OCR is a lookup tool.
3. **Vocabulary mining.** You want every word you OCR to become a flashcard you'll review later. The OCR is a pipeline into an SRS, not a one-shot lookup.

Most apps are built for use case 1. A smaller number handle 2. Almost none handle 3 without significant manual work. Knowing which one you need determines which app is "best" — there is no winner across all three.

## The three categories

### General-purpose OCR (Google Lens, Apple Live Text, Microsoft Edge mobile)

**Strength:** uncanny accuracy on printed text. Live Text on modern iOS recognises Japanese in photos almost as well as in screenshots. Google Lens translates on top of OCR, so you get the meaning even if you can't read a single character.

**Weakness:** it's a dead-end for learning. The recognition result is plain text — no furigana, no integration with a dictionary or SRS, no way to capture what you scanned as a flashcard. You read the translation once and forget the word. If you want to *learn* Japanese, Lens is a lookup tool, not a study tool.

**Use case:** travel, menus, signage, packages. Use case 1.

### Dictionary apps with OCR built in (Imiwa, Nihongo, KanjiSnap)

**Strength:** the OCR result flows directly into a dictionary lookup, so you get reading, meaning, conjugation, examples. Imiwa (iOS/Android) has had OCR for years; Nihongo (iOS/Android) ships it as a Pro feature; KanjiSnap (iOS) leans on Apple's Live Text. Many of these apps let you star the word for later — a soft version of vocabulary capture.

**Weakness:** the OCR feature itself is often a secondary citizen. Recognition quality varies, especially on stylised fonts or handwritten text. The "star" list is not a spaced-repetition system — you'll accumulate 500 starred words and never review them. The OCR is a lookup tool with a memory, not a learning tool. Note that some popular dictionaries (Akebi on Android, Shirabe Jisho on iOS/Android) do not have built-in OCR at all — they're excellent lookup tools, but you type or paste the word yourself.

**Use case:** reading support, intermediate-level lookup. Use case 2.

### Manga-specific OCR tools (manga-ocr model, Poricom, YomiNinja, browser extensions)

**Strength:** tuned for the specific problem of manga. The open-source `manga-ocr` model handles vertical text, multi-line speech bubbles, and stylised fonts better than general-purpose engines. Desktop wrappers (Poricom, YomiNinja) and browser extensions (Manga OCR for Chrome, Namida-OCR) integrate the recognition into the reading flow — select a panel, get the text.

**Weakness:** narrow. They work on manga, not on textbook scans or photos of real-world text. And the same retention gap applies: the OCR feeds a lookup, not an SRS, unless you've piped it into Anki via Yomitan + AnkiConnect. The manga-mining power users typically run that three-app stack.

**Use case:** manga-reading support for learners willing to configure a multi-tool pipeline. Use case 2.

### Learning-integrated OCR (where Origa sits)

Origa is built for use case 3 — vocabulary mining. The OCR is the entry point to a card-creation pipeline: scan a photo, paste a screenshot, or photograph a textbook page. The OCR runs locally (NDLOCR-Lite on the device, no upload), extracts the words, and each one becomes a flashcard with reading, translation, audio, and the sentence it appeared in. (See [how Origa handles OCR, furigana, and vocabulary linkage](/features).)

The trade-off is explicit: Origa is not a translation tool and not a dictionary lookup app. If you only want to know what a sign says once, Google Lens is faster. Origa is for the learner whose goal is to never need to look that word up again.

## What to look for in a Japanese OCR app

A checklist that actually separates the categories:

- **Where does the OCR result go?** Plain text only = translation tool. Dictionary entry = lookup tool. Flashcard pipeline = learning tool. The first two don't help you retain anything.
- **Does it run on-device or in the cloud?** Cloud OCR is often more accurate but requires an internet connection and sends your photos to a server. On-device OCR (NDLOCR, Apple Vision framework, on-device ML models) works offline and is private. Neither is universally better — pick based on whether you need offline + privacy or maximum accuracy.
- **Does it handle vertical text?** Japanese is frequently set vertically, especially in manga and novels. Many general-purpose OCR engines are tuned for horizontal text and scramble vertical input.
- **Does it handle furigana?** Furigana is small kana printed next to kanji. Cheap OCR reads it as a separate word and pollutes the output. Better OCR either ignores furigana or associates it with the right kanji.
- **Is the OCR the end of the pipeline or the start of one?** This is the question most "best OCR app" lists skip. If the answer is "end," you have a lookup tool. If "start," you have a learning tool.

## How Origa handles this

Concretely, where Origa sits on each of those axes:

- **Pipeline:** OCR → word extraction → flashcard with sentence + reading + translation + audio → FSRS-scheduled review. Each scanned word becomes a card you'll see again.
- **On-device.** NDLOCR-Lite runs locally. Scanning works in airplane mode. Nothing leaves the device.
- **Vertical text:** supported.
- **Furigana handling:** Origa generates its own furigana on the kanji it extracts, then hides it on kanji you've learned. The OCR doesn't have to disambiguate printed furigana because the system produces its own.
- **Dictionary integrated.** The OCR result goes straight into a bilingual dictionary; you don't copy-paste into a second app.

The framing is: Origa is the OCR app for learners who got tired of having Lens, a dictionary app, and Anki as three separate tools, and who wanted the OCR to actually feed their study pipeline.

## Known limitations (the honest part)

- **Origa is not a translation app.** If you need to read a sign once, use Google Lens. Origa's pipeline is overkill for one-shot lookups.
- **OCR is not perfect on stylised fonts.** Hand-drawn manga lettering, decorative fonts, and some sfx get misread. Budget for manual correction.
- **It's not a manga reader.** You can scan panels, but Origa doesn't display the manga itself. Pair it with a reader of your choice.
- **No Yomitan integration today.** If your workflow is Yomitan → Anki, Origa doesn't slot into that pipeline directly yet. You can import existing Anki decks, so migration is one-way and lossless, but the live pipe isn't there.
- **Mobile OCR quality depends on camera and lighting.** Same as every phone OCR app. Sharp photo, even light, no skew — the usual rules apply.

## How to pick

You almost certainly already have a general-purpose OCR app on your phone (Live Text on iOS, Lens on Android). For most one-off translation needs, that's enough and it's free. The question is whether you've outgrown "translate once" and need "capture and learn". If you have — if you keep seeing the same kanji and not remembering it, if you've tried starring words in a dictionary app and never reviewed them, if your manga reading generates words you forget by the next chapter — then a learning-integrated OCR is the missing piece. For how Origa compares with Anki, WaniKani, and the other tools mentioned here, see the [full comparison](/compare), or [download Origa](/download) to try the pipeline end-to-end.

## FAQ

**Is Japanese OCR accurate enough to rely on?**
On clean printed horizontal text, modern OCR (Apple Live Text, Google Lens, NDLOCR) is reliable enough for everyday lookup. On vertical manga text and stylised fonts, expect more errors and budget for manual correction — vendor-published accuracy numbers are rare and always tied to a specific test set, so don't trust round percentages you read in marketing copy. Handwritten or decorative text is still unreliable across the board.

**Does OCR work offline?**
Depends on the app. Cloud-based OCR (most translation apps) requires internet. On-device OCR (Origa's NDLOCR-Lite, Apple Live Text) works offline. If you study on the train or on a plane, on-device matters.

**Can I OCR manga into flashcards?**
Yes, but you need a pipeline that connects OCR to an SRS. Origa does this end-to-end. The alternative is Yomitan → Anki, which is more configurable but requires setup.

**Why not just use Google Lens?**
Lens is excellent for one-shot translation. It is not a learning tool — the OCR result is plain text with no path to spaced repetition. If you want to remember what you scanned, you need a different category of app.

**Does Origa's OCR send my photos to a server?**
No. NDLOCR-Lite runs on the device. Scans never leave your phone or computer.
