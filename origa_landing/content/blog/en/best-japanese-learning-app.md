# Best Japanese Learning App: How to Choose in 2026

The query "best Japanese learning app" is a query without a correct answer. Not because there are few apps, but because every learner has a different goal: one is taking JLPT N3 for a work visa, another wants to read manga in the original, a third is starting from zero and doesn't know how hiragana differs from kanji. The app that's ideal for the first goal is usually useless for the third.

This article is not a top-10 list or an ad. It's a category-by-category breakdown: which app solves which problem, where each one is strong, and where each hits a wall. At the end — how to choose for your situation, including the case where you study Japanese through Russian (or Vietnamese, or Korean) rather than through English.

## Why "best app" is the wrong question

Japanese is not one skill but at least four: vocabulary, kanji, grammar, listening. Plus JLPT-level comprehension if you're taking the exam. Almost every popular app covers one or two categories well, and the rest superficially or not at all.

So the typical picture of someone studying Japanese is three to five apps at once: vocabulary in one, kanji in another, grammar in a third, listening drawn from YouTube. Each app with its own scheduling system, its own dictionary, its own interface. Stitching them together takes as much time as the studying itself.

"Best app" in reality means: **the best set for your specific goal**, without duplication and without gaps.

## Categories and who's strong in them

### Vocabulary and spaced repetition

The base skill is memorizing words and not forgetting them. Spaced repetition systems (SRS) dominate here. The FSRS algorithm is the current standard: it adjusts review intervals based on how you, specifically, forget a specific card.

- **Anki.** Free, open source, runs everywhere. Maximum flexibility: cards can be laid out however you want, decks are configurable. The flip side of that flexibility is that cards need to be created and formatted manually. For Japanese, that means: open a dictionary, copy the word, then the reading, then the translation, then find audio. The interface is English; there are community Russian decks, but the app itself is built for an English speaker. [FSRS](https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html#fsrs) appeared in Anki 23.10 (October 2023) and is on by default for new collections starting in 24.10.
- **Origa.** The app I work on. Uses the same FSRS, but card creation is reduced to typing a word: the built-in bilingual dictionary pulls in the reading, translation, and audio on its own. You can import existing Anki decks (`.anki2`, `.anki21`) — progress transfers. Interface and dictionaries are in your language.

If your pain is creating cards manually, an alternative makes sense. If you've already assembled the perfect system in Anki and it works for you — there's nothing to change.

### Kanji

Kanji is a separate problem. The same 食 appears in dozens of words, and it's important not just to memorize the character but to see it in different contexts.

- **[WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/).** Structured path through radicals, English interface, paid subscription. Suitable if you're starting kanji from zero and want a fixed order. The downside — you learn what the program deems necessary, not what you encountered today in a manga or article. For the wider Origa-vs-WaniKani trade-offs (radical order vs. content-driven, paid vs. free, English-only vs. four UI languages), see the [full comparison](/compare).
- **Origa.** Furigana is generated automatically and hidden on learned kanji — what you've already studied is no longer hinted at, forcing you to recall the reading. Kanji are linked to vocabulary: the system knows that 食べる and 食事 share one kanji, and tracks it across all the words where you've encountered it. (See [how Origa handles kanji, furigana, and vocabulary linkage](/features).)

The approaches differ: WaniKani leads you up its own ladder, Origa teaches what you actually encounter in your content.

### Grammar

- **[Bunpro](https://bunpro.jp/).** Grammar SRS, web-based, English interface. Suitable if your narrow task is to slice grammar into spaced repetition. Vocabulary lives in a separate app.
- **Origa.** Structured grammar reference by JLPT levels (N5–N1). The feature: examples for grammar rules are built on words you've already learned — you see the rule in a familiar context and focus on the rule itself, not on the vocabulary.

### Listening and phrases

Listening is the weak spot of most apps. Study audio is often synthetic, and live speech has to be hunted for separately.

Origa has a built-in database of more than 200,000 phrases from native Japanese content — anime, visual novels, everyday speech — with original voice acting. Phrases are selected for your current vocabulary level using the N+1 approach: slightly above your level, to stretch but not break. This is closed content, not something you bring yourself.

### JLPT and testing

- **[Migii](https://eup.java-mind.com/).** Exam simulator, timed practice. Useful specifically for drilling the test format. It doesn't replace a memorization system — it tests, it doesn't teach.
- **Origa.** Tracks JLPT level, ties the grammar reference and kanji dictionaries to N5–N1 levels, shows progress analytics. That's the foundation on which Migii then trains the format.

## Summary table

| Category | Best choice if… | App |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vocabulary, full control | You need flexibility and are willing to configure | Anki |
| Vocabulary, minimal routine | You want to type a word and immediately get a card | Origa |
| Kanji from scratch, ordered | You need a fixed path through radicals | WaniKani |
| Kanji from your own content | You study what you actually read | Origa |
| Grammar only | You need a separate grammar trainer | Bunpro |
| Grammar linked with vocabulary | You want examples on familiar words | Origa |
| Listening | You need native phrases with audio | Origa |
| JLPT exam format | Timed test practice | Migii |

## A separate case: Japanese not through English

Here is the market's biggest gap. Most of the apps listed above are built for an English-speaking learner. WaniKani, Bunpro, [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) in their deep core — English interface, English explanations, English dictionaries.

If you study Japanese through Russian (or Vietnamese, or Korean), that creates double load: first you translate the Japanese word into English (a second intermediary), then English into your native language. This isn't a philosophical protest — it's lost time on every single word.

The search for "Japanese learning app in [your language]" runs into almost no strong competition — the market is underserved. Origa is built for this from day one: interface, dictionaries, and grammar explanations in Russian, Vietnamese, and Korean. Not as a localized layer translated from English, but as the native interface language.

## How to choose

1. **Identify the bottleneck.** What in your current setup eats the most time — card creation, kanji search, grammar, listening? That's what needs to be closed.
2. **Check the scheduler quality.** If an app uses naive spaced repetition or fixed intervals instead of FSRS — you're trading real retention for a friendly interface. That's a bad trade.
3. **Look at the interface language.** If you don't study through English, apps with an English core will slow you down at every step.
4. **Check migration.** If you already have an Anki deck, make sure the new app imports it. Throwing away years of progress is an unjustified cost.

In most cases a working set is one memorization app plus one or two specialized tools (grammar, exam format). The goal is not to find "one best app" but to cover categories without duplication. Origa tries to be the one app that covers vocabulary, kanji, grammar, and listening together — but the limitations are honestly stated below.

## Origa's limitations

- **Not as deep customization as Anki.** If you build your own HTML/CSS card templates, Origa won't replace that. The priority is a low entry barrier, not maximum control.
- **The app is younger.** Anki has a decade of edge-case hardening and a huge library of ready-made decks. Origa's prebuilt content library is smaller, though growing.
- **No iOS.** Origa runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and in the browser; iOS is planned but not yet available. If you study only on an iPhone, that's a real blocker today.
- **Desktop/mobile parity is good but not absolute.** Before fully switching, check the current build for your platform.

## FAQ

**Is Origa's spaced repetition the same as Anki's?**
Yes, both use FSRS. Origa didn't invent it and doesn't claim otherwise. The difference is what surrounds the scheduler: card creation, furigana, kanji tracking, grammar — not the algorithm itself.

**Can I keep my Anki decks?**
Yes. Origa imports `.anki2`, `.anki21`, and `.anki21b` — decks and review history transfer.

**Is Origa free?**
Yes, the app is currently free across all platforms.

**Does it work offline?**
Yes. The OCR and speech recognition models run locally, so card creation and review work without internet.

**What if I only study on iPhone?**
Not yet. Origa runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and the web. iOS is planned — if iPhone is your only device, wait for the iOS release or stay on Anki.
