# Best Apps to Learn Japanese Offline: What "Offline" Actually Means

"Offline" is one of those words that means whatever the marketing department needs it to mean. Some apps call themselves "offline" because their flashcards work without a connection. Others mean "the dictionary is cached locally." A few mean "every feature, including OCR and voice recognition, runs on the device." When you search for the best app to learn Japanese offline, the useful first question is: offline *what*?

This is a breakdown of what offline means in the major categories of Japanese-learning apps, what you actually get without a connection, and what you give up. It includes Origa, the app I work on, with its limits stated plainly — Origa is built for offline-first, but offline-first is not offline-perfect.

## Why offline matters

Three concrete scenarios, not philosophy:

- **Travel and commuting.** Subway, plane, train through a tunnel, a week in a country with expensive data. If your study app drops to "you need a connection" the moment you board the train, it's useless for those 45 minutes a day.
- **Privacy.** Cloud-based apps send your voice, photos, and reading history to a server. That data is valuable to the company, and to whoever buys the company later. On-device processing keeps it on your phone.
- **Subscriptions and lock-in.** Online-first apps usually gate features behind a recurring payment. Cancel the subscription, lose access. Offline-first apps, especially open or source-available ones, tend to let you keep what you've built.

Most learners don't need offline every minute. They need it for the commute, for travel, and for the small privacy dignity of not having their study habits logged. Knowing which app gives you which of these — without surprises — is what "best offline app" actually comes down to.

## The four layers of "offline"

It helps to separate the layers, because apps mix and match them:

1. **Offline review.** Your existing flashcards are on the device. You can review them without internet. This is the minimum.
2. **Offline lookup.** The dictionary is on the device. You can search a word and get a translation without a connection.
3. **Offline content creation.** You can add new cards from text, from a photo (OCR), or from audio (speech-to-text) without sending data anywhere.
4. **Offline AI.** The language models that power OCR, speech recognition, furigana generation, etc., run on the device.

An app that is "offline" in layer 1 but not in layer 3 is, in practice, an app that stops growing the moment you lose connectivity. You can review yesterday's cards on the subway, but you can't add new ones from a manga you're reading. That's a real limitation, and it's where most "offline" apps actually sit.

## The landscape, by category

### Anki (desktop and AnkiDroid)

**Offline layers:** 1 (review), partially 2 (if you have a local dictionary add-on), not 3 or 4.

Anki desktop is the reference offline SRS. Your decks live on your disk; reviews work with zero connectivity. AnkiDroid mirrors that on Android. AnkiWeb sync requires internet, but it's optional — you can sync once and review offline for weeks.

Where Anki's offline breaks down: card *creation* for Japanese still requires external lookup. If you want to add a word with reading, translation, and audio, you typically use a browser to find that data, then paste it in. The actual *learning* works offline; the *preparation* usually doesn't.

**Best for:** learners who already have a deck system set up and want bulletproof offline review. Not for: learners who expect to capture new vocabulary on the go without a second app.

### AnkiMobile (iOS, paid)

Same as Anki desktop in offline capability. The ~$25 one-time purchase funds development of the free desktop and Android versions. Offline review is rock-solid; offline card creation has the same lookup gap as desktop.

### Duolingo (limited offline)

**Offline layers:** 1, for downloaded lessons only.

Duolingo lets you download a lesson pack and complete it offline. The lesson is pre-built — it's review of existing content, not exploration or new vocabulary capture. Duolingo's whole design is server-driven: streaks, leaderboards, adaptive difficulty all assume connectivity. The offline mode is a fallback for travellers, not a design principle.

**Best for:** casual learners on a flight. Not for: anyone who treats offline as a feature rather than a fallback.

### WaniKani, Bunpro (online-only)

**Offline layers:** none meaningful.

WaniKani and Bunpro are web apps. Reviews and lessons both happen on their servers. There's no offline mode. If you're on a plane, you're not studying WaniKani. This isn't a flaw — these services are designed around their servers' scheduling logic — but it's worth knowing before committing.

### Dictionary apps (Akebi, Imiwa, Shirabe Jisho)

**Offline layers:** 2 (lookup), sometimes 1 (starred words).

These apps ship their dictionary on-device. Lookup works without a connection. Most have a "favorites" feature that approximates a flashcard list, but without spaced repetition — it's a flat list you scroll through. Useful as a tool, not as a study system.

### Learning-integrated apps with on-device AI (where Origa sits)

**Offline layers:** 1, 2, 3, and 4 — by design.

Origa was built to run offline end-to-end. The SRS works offline (layer 1). The bilingual dictionary is on-device (layer 2). Card creation from a photo or screenshot works offline (layer 3) because the OCR (NDLOCR-Lite) runs locally (layer 4). Speech-to-text for adding cards from audio also runs locally. There's no server call in the normal study flow.

The framing: if you want to study Japanese on a 12-hour flight without paying for wifi, Origa's whole feature set works. The catch is in the limitations below.

## What you trade for offline

Offline-first is not free, and the trade-offs are worth knowing before committing.

- **App size.** On-device AI models are large. Origa ships with NDLOCR-Lite and a Whisper STT model — together, these add hundreds of megabytes to the install. Cloud-based apps stay small because the heavy lifting happens on a server.
- **Battery and CPU.** Local OCR and STT use your device's processor. On older phones, scanning a manga page takes a couple of seconds and warms the device. Cloud OCR is faster on slow hardware.
- **Accuracy ceilings.** Cloud OCR and translation models are often more accurate than on-device ones, because they can be larger. NDLOCR-Lite is good; Google's server-side Vision API is sometimes better. The gap is narrowing, but it exists.
- **Update lag.** Cloud apps improve silently on the server. Offline-first apps ship model updates as app updates — you have to update the app to get a better OCR model.

For most learners these trade-offs are worth it. For someone with an older phone and a fast, free, always-on connection, they might not be.

## How Origa handles this

Specifics, so the claims are checkable:

- **Local SRS.** FSRS runs on-device. Review works in airplane mode.
- **Local dictionary.** Bilingual dictionaries (English/Russian/Vietnamese/Korean paired with Japanese) are bundled with the app.
- **Local OCR (NDLOCR-Lite).** Scan a photo or paste a screenshot, words are recognised on-device.
- **Local STT (Whisper).** Add a card from audio without sending the audio to a server.
- **Local furigana generation.** Furigana over kanji is produced by an on-device model and hides automatically on kanji you've learned.

There is no feature in Origa's normal flow that requires an internet connection. The only thing that needs connectivity is the initial download and optional cloud sync.

## Known limitations (Origa, honest)

- **App size.** Hundreds of megabytes for the AI models. If storage is tight on your phone, this matters.
- **OCR accuracy on stylised fonts.** Local OCR is good on standard text, weaker on manga lettering and decorative fonts. Manual correction is sometimes needed.
- **Battery on intensive use.** Scanning many pages in a session will drain battery faster than text-only review.
- **No iOS yet.** Origa runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and web. iOS is on the roadmap. If you need offline study on an iPhone today, AnkiMobile or AnkiDroid-on-Android-via-emulator are the realistic options.

## How to choose

If your offline need is "review my existing Anki deck on the subway" — AnkiMobile (iOS) or AnkiDroid (Android) is the cheapest, most proven answer.

If your offline need is "I'm travelling for a month with bad connectivity and I want to keep adding vocabulary from manga and textbooks I encounter" — you need an app where OCR and content creation work offline, not just review. Origa is built for that exact use case.

If you don't actually need offline — if you study at home on wifi and don't care about privacy — the online-first apps (WaniKani, Bunpro, Duolingo) are perfectly good. Don't buy "offline-first" as a feature you won't use; the trade-offs are real. For how Origa compares with the other tools above, see the [full comparison](/compare); if offline-first is your priority, [download Origa](/download) and put it on a flight.

## FAQ

**Does Origa work fully offline?**
Yes. OCR, STT, SRS, dictionary, and furigana all run on-device. You can study end-to-end without an internet connection after the initial install.

**Why would I want offline OCR?**
Two reasons: privacy (your photos don't leave your device) and travel (you can scan manga on a plane). If neither matters to you, cloud OCR is sometimes more accurate.

**What's the trade-off for offline?**
App size (hundreds of MB for AI models), battery use during intensive OCR, and slightly lower accuracy than the best cloud services on stylised text.

**Can I sync Origa across devices?**
Yes, optionally. Sync requires internet; everything else works without.

**Is Anki better for offline than Origa?**
Anki is better if your offline need is pure review of an existing deck — it's lighter and more proven. Origa is better if you need to create new cards offline from photos, audio, or text. They're optimised for different parts of the workflow.
