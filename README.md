## 🎯 Principles

* **Learn from your own content** — you choose what to study. The app adapts to what you already know and what you're reading, watching, or listening to right now.
* **Smart algorithms** — FSRS spaced repetition system (like Anki) optimizes review intervals for each word.
* **Privacy** — all AI models and data processing run locally, nothing is sent to the cloud.
* **Offline-first** — full functionality without internet.
* **Cross-platform** — Web, Windows, Linux, macOS, Android.
* **Learn in your language** — interface and dictionaries in Russian and English (more languages planned).
* **JLPT analytics** — track your current level and forecast your progress.

## 📊 Comparison with Other Apps

*How Origa compares to popular tools and how you can use them together.*

### Anki

A powerful and flexible spaced repetition app for any material.

* **When to use Anki:** you need absolute customization freedom, custom HTML/CSS cards, or you're studying many subjects beyond Japanese.
* **Origa's advantage:** save time creating cards, quickly load your content, with vocabulary + kanji + grammar in a single ecosystem.

### ReWord

A flashcard-based vocabulary memorization app.

* **When to use ReWord:** quick start and mechanical memorization of basic word lists without context.
* **Origa's advantage:** vocabulary is tied to your content, grammar, and native audio — giving you a deeper understanding of the language.

### Bunpro

A specialized grammar trainer (Grammar SRS).

* **When to use Bunpro:** you want to focus exclusively on drilling grammar rules.
* **Origa's advantage:** grammar examples are built on *words you've already learned* — vocabulary and grammar work as a unified whole.

### WaniKani

A popular kanji and vocabulary learning service using mnemonics.

* **When to use WaniKani:** a rigid order of learning kanji by radicals from scratch works for you.
* **Origa's advantage:** you learn exactly the kanji and words you encountered today — in manga, an article, or at work.

### Duolingo

An engaging app that gradually immerses you in a language.

* **Pair with Origa:** use Duolingo for an easy start and initial vocabulary and kanji base. Origa will reinforce that material, fill grammar gaps, and transition knowledge from a gamified form into practical use.

### Migii

A serious JLPT test preparation simulator.

* **Pair with Origa:** use Migii to practice solving exam tests against the clock. Origa serves as your foundation to comprehensively collect and reinforce all the material needed to pass those tests.
