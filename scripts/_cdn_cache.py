"""Tiered Cache-Control policy for CDN objects.

Files are split into three categories by how often they change:

- TRULY-STATIC (immutable, 1 year): ML models (ndlocr/whisper), kanji stroke
  art, recorded audio, the compiled lindera system dictionary, and self-hosted
  web fonts. These move only on rare deliberate events — a model retrain, a
  lindera version bump, a font swap — never on a content release. Fonts are
  content-addressed (the file hash is in the name), so a changed glyph ships
  under a new URL and the immutable copy cannot poison the edge cache.
- RELEASE-UPDATED (5 min, must-revalidate): content JSON shipped or corrected
  every release (grammar, phrases, dictionary chunks, JLPT sets, pitch). This
  is the fix for the PR #182 edge-cache poisoning: S3 updated grammar.json but
  the CDN edge kept serving its year-long immutable copy until the cache was
  flushed by hand.
- ALWAYS-FRESH (no-cache): manifest.json — the client's change-detection
  beacon, re-fetched every session.

Any path matching no rule falls back to the conservative release-updated
policy: a 5-min 304 revalidation is cheap when unchanged and bounds staleness
to 5 min when it does change — strictly safer than immutable for the unknown.
